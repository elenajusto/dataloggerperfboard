# Datalogger Perfboard

## About Project
First breadboarded at a UTS Rocketry avionics workshop, this system has its sites for a ride to the sky onboard an LPR!

## Progress
Currently suffering from potential shorts, messy solder and a yet to be attached battery/connector.
Additionaly requires a mount for it to be attached onto a rocket.
