# Datalogger Perfboard

## About Project
First breadboarded at a UTS Rocketry avionics workshop, this system has its sites for a ride to the sky onboard an LPR!

## Progress
Battery connector added.
Switched to Arduino Nano MCU.
Everything is soldered with no shorts however sensors are failing to initialise.
Requires a mount for it to be attached onto a rocket.
